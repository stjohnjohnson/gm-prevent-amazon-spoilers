Prevent Amazon Wishlist Spoilers (GreaseMonkey)
===============================================

So the problem right now is that if you checked off the box in your Wishlist that 'Prevents spoiling the surprise,' it really doesn't help much. When you attempt to edit the comments/ranking on an item purchased for you, you get this lovely message:
![Purchased](http://i.imgur.com/Hd2dR.png)

If it wasn't purchased, you don't see that message and instead get the 'Quantity Purchased' field:
![Not Purchased](http://i.imgur.com/KPmBK.png)

After this script, everything is cleaned up, regardless of purchase status.. so it's all hidden!

Hopefully this will help prevent Amazon from spoiling your Holidays.. it was too late for me..
